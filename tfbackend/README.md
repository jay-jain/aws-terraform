* Use Terraform to provision backend in one project and use separate projects to provision other resources: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61851903/how-to-solve-error-loading-state-accessdenied-access-denied-status-code-403-w)

  

  

# Create Backend

  

  

## Configure the `main.tf` file

  

  

```

module "terraform_state_backend" {
	source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.git?ref=tags/0.26.0"
	namespace = "DevSecOpsGroup"
	stage = "dev"
	name = var.name_prefix
	attributes = ["state"]
	region = "us-east-1"
	terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
	terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
	force_destroy = false
}
 

```

  

  

## Download Terraform modules and providers

  

  

  

`terraform init`

  

  

  

## Create S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Lock Table (state is still stored locally)

  

  

`terraform apply -auto-approve`

  

  

  

The following resources are created when the above command is run:

  

  

* S3 Bucket

  

  

*  [S3 Public Access Block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_public_access_block)

  

  

* DynamoDB Table

  

  

* A file called `backend.tf` that stores the backend configuration. It should look something like this:

  

  

```

  

  

backend "s3" {

  

region = "us-east-1"

  

bucket = "< the name of the S3 state bucket >"

  

key = "terraform.tfstate"

  

dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB locking table >"

  

profile = ""

  

role_arn = ""

  

encrypt = true

  

}

  

  

```

  

  

* Additionally the `bucket_id` and `lock_table_id` parameters are output.

  

  

  

Note: If you want to use the S3 Remote Backend, you will need to use the `backend.tf` file generated here in other terraform project folders; otherwise the backend will be stored locally by default.

  

  

## Copy state from local backend to S3/DynamoDB backend

  

  

**Make sure that you have copied the `backend.tf` to your working directory where you are running this init command:**

  

`terraform init -force-copy`

  

  

  

**Do not run the above command in the `tfbackend` directory. Run it in the directory where you are deploying actual resources.**

  

  

# Deleting Remote Backend

  

  

## Change tfbackend.tf to:

  

  

  

```

  

  

module "terraform_state_backend" {

  

...

  

terraform_backend_config_file_path = ""

  

force_destroy = true

  

}

  

  

```

  

  

  

## Deletes backend.tf

  

  

  

`terraform apply -target module.terraform_state_backend -auto-approve`

  

  

  

  

## Move Terraform state from S3 backend to local files

  

  

  

`terraform init -force-copy`

  

  

  

## Delete all resources in deployment

  

  

  

`terraform destroy`

  

  

  

  

## Examine the `terraform.tfstate` file to make sure it contains no resources to verify state has been deleted

  

  

# Logging

  

## PowerShell

To enable Terraform logging in Powershell:

  

```Powershell

  

> $env:TF_LOG="TRACE"

  

> $env:TF_LOG_PATH="logs.txt"

  

```

  

You can save these settings in your PowerShell profile. To find your profile, use the `$profile` command and add the above lines to the given file.

Other options for logging include `DEBUG `, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. You can also name your log file whatever you like.

  

## Bash

Open your `.bashrc` file and enter the following text:

```Bash

# Terraform log settings

export TF_LOG=TRACE

export TF_LOG_PATH="logs.txt"

```

Other options for logging include `DEBUG `, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`. You can also name your log file whatever you like.


# ARN Formats
GovCloud and China regions have different naming schema. Find GovCloud arn format **[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/using-govcloud-arns.html)**.

The CloudPosse module allows you to specify a different arn format with the `arn_format` variable that you can pass in. For instance:
```
module  "terraform_state_backend" {
	source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend.git?ref=tags/0.26.0"
	
	namespace = "devsecops-group"
	
	stage = "dev"
	
	name = var.name_prefix

	attributes = ["state"]

	terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."

	terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"

	force_destroy = false

	arn_format = "arn:aws-us-gov"
}
```
