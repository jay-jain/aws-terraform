# Codepipeline Demo
This demonstration is based on [Edward Viaene's](https://github.com/wardviaene/)  [codepipline-demo repository](https://github.com/wardviaene/terraform-course/tree/master/codepipeline-demo) with two minor revisions:
* No KMS Encryption
* Using GitHub repo instead of CodeCommit repo. I forked Edward's [docker-demo](https://github.com/wardviaene/docker-demo) repository into my own GitHub account.

Also remember to create a ```terraform.tfvars``` file with the corresponding variable values from the ```vars.tf``` file.
